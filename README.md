> **Observe what's happening *inside* your ML system — not just around it.**

A production-grade MLOps observability stack that combines infrastructure anomaly detection with deep ML pipeline visibility: model drift scores, prediction confidence distributions, and feature shift detection exposed as Prometheus metrics and visualised in Grafana.

Part of a public SRE/AIOps portfolio by **Thomas Asamba** — Senior SRE and Cloud/DevOps Engineer, Nairobi.

## The problem this solves

Standard infrastructure monitoring tells you *that* a service is slow or erroring. It cannot tell you *why* the model started making worse predictions last Tuesday. For that you need to observe the model itself:

- Are the features being scored today drawn from the same distribution the model was trained on?
- Is the model's confidence degrading — probabilities clustering toward 0.5?
- Has the default rate in live predictions shifted relative to the training baseline?

This platform answers those questions continuously, in production, with zero manual intervention.

## Architecture

![MLOps Observability Platform Architecture](docs/architecture/architecture-overview.png)

The platform has two observability layers. The infrastructure layer (Layer 1) watches CPU, memory, disk, and network using Z-Score, EWMA, and Isolation Forest. The ML pipeline layer (Layer 2) watches what's happening *inside* the model — feature distributions, prediction confidence, and drift scores.

### Metrics pipeline

### Logs pipeline

## What's inside

### ML Pipeline (`app/pipeline/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `train.py` | RandomForestClassifier with full MLflow tracking — params, metrics, feature importances, model registration |
| `predict.py` | Lazy-loaded model singleton, rolling prediction buffer, confidence flagging, thread-safe batch inference |
| `drift_detector.py` | PSI + KS-test drift detection; frequency-table PSI for discrete features; background thread with configurable interval |

### Serving Layer (`app/serving/`)

FastAPI inference server on port 8006. Single-worker (intentional — in-process prediction buffer). Endpoints:

```
POST /predict              Single credit scoring prediction
POST /predict/batch        Batch predictions (up to 500 records)
GET  /drift/status         Latest drift detection status
GET  /drift/report         Full per-feature PSI/KS breakdown
GET  /health/live          Liveness probe
GET  /health/ready         Readiness probe (model loaded check)
GET  /metrics              Prometheus text exposition
GET  /status               Service status + prediction stats
```

### Metrics Exporter (`app/exporter/`)

Standalone Prometheus exporter on port 8007. Bridges MLflow experiment metrics (ROC-AUC, F1, training duration) and dataset statistics into Prometheus so Grafana can show model quality over time without scraping MLflow directly.

### Infrastructure Anomaly Detection (`app/anomaly_detection/`)

Z-Score, EWMA, and Isolation Forest on CPU/memory/disk/network metrics. Composite weighted scoring with Alertmanager integration. Separate from the ML pipeline layer — watches *around* the model, not inside it.

## Drift detection design

Two complementary methods run on every cycle:

**PSI (Population Stability Index)**
Measures how much the current feature distribution has shifted from the training baseline. Uses training-set percentile bins as the reference — so the baseline proportion is exactly `1/n_bins` per bin by construction, and only the current data needs to be binned.

For integer-valued features (`missed_payments`, `num_credit_lines`) where percentile bins degenerate, frequency-table PSI is used instead — comparing empirical `P(X=k)` from training against the live distribution.

| PSI | Interpretation |
|-----|---------------|
| < 0.10 | Stable — no action needed |
| 0.10–0.25 | Moderate shift — monitor |
| > 0.25 | Significant drift — investigate or retrain |

**KS-test**
Non-parametric test for whether two samples come from the same distribution. `p < 0.05` → statistically significant shift. Can detect subtle distributional changes that PSI misses (e.g. shape changes without mean shift).

**Confidence degradation tracking**
As drift increases, model probabilities cluster toward 0.5 — the model becomes uncertain. `ml_prediction_confidence_mean` dropping below 0.40 is a leading indicator of accuracy degradation, visible in Grafana before ROC-AUC degrades in MLflow.

## Test results

> Unit tests run fully offline — no MLflow server or inference server required.
> Integration tests require all four services running (MLflow, inference server, metrics exporter, and at least one completed drift check cycle).

```
tests/unit/test_training.py        24 passed   7.3s   (offline)
tests/unit/test_predict.py         30 passed   9.5s   (offline)
tests/unit/test_drift_detector.py  32 passed   5.4s   (offline)
tests/integration/test_pipeline.py 33 passed  52.0s   (requires live services)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                              119 passed  74.2s
```

**Chaos test** (`tests/chaos/inject_drift.py`) validates the full signal chain end-to-end — from drifted CSV → HTTP batch requests → prediction buffer → background drift check → `/drift/status` API response:

```
Injecting 300 drifted records  → drift detected after  2 polls  (20s)
Injecting 300 baseline records → drift clears  after 11 polls (110s)
```

Confidence mean shift during chaos test: `0.595` (drifted) → `0.314` (stable) — model uncertainty as a leading indicator.

## Prometheus Metrics Overview

The platform exports metrics across three dimensions: **drift detection**, **prediction quality**, and **model performance**.

| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Drift Detection** | `ml_drift_detected`, `ml_feature_drift_psi{feature}`, `ml_feature_drift_ks_pvalue{feature}` | Feature distribution shift (PSI > 0.25 = alert) |
| **Prediction Health** | `ml_prediction_confidence_mean`, `ml_prediction_default_rate`, `ml_predictions_total{decision}` | Model confidence and decision breakdown |
| **Model Quality** | `mlflow_run_metric{metric="test_roc_auc"}`, `mlflow_run_metric{metric="test_f1"}` | Latest trained model metrics |
| **Infrastructure** | `infrastructure_cpu_zscore`, `infrastructure_memory_ewma`, `infrastructure_disk_isolation_forest` | Anomaly detection on CPU/memory/disk |

## Alert Rules

The platform fires alerts when metrics exceed operational thresholds:

| Alert | Condition | Severity | Action |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| `ModelDriftDetected` | PSI > 0.25 for 2m | ⚠️ Warning | Check feature distributions |
| `PredictionConfidenceLow` | mean confidence < 0.35 for 5m | ⚠️ Warning | Model uncertainty increasing |
| `ModelAccuracyDegraded` | ROC-AUC < 0.75 | 🔴 Critical | Investigate or retrain |
| `HighDefaultRate` | default_rate > 50% for 10m | ⚠️ Warning | Portfolio risk shift |
| `InferenceServerDown` | server unreachable for 1m | 🔴 Critical | Restore server |
